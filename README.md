# Nate Garrow's Personal Portfolio Site

[This project](https://nategarrow.tech) was built to replace the previous portfolio site built in 2020. This stack uses the following:

* Gatsby
* Prismic
* TypeScript
* Three.js (React-Three-Fiber)


## Challenges (a.k.a. Learning Opportunities)

- TypeScript: This site was my first attempt using TypeScript. While there weren't many issues related to typing, I learned quite a bit. Biggest challenge taught me when to use `React.PropsWithChildren`. And personally, I prefer `interface` more!

- Three.js: While `react-three-fiber` did a lot of the heavy lifting, this was an early attempt at adding a three-dimensional object to a website for me. And I must say I enjoyed it! I love the new dimension it brings to a website and playing in Blender, even if just making a simple icosagon (a shape chosen for my liking of D&D - I'm usually my party's dice goblin), made me want to dive in deeper, creating more advanced objects.

## Where to Next?

Lately I have been diving in to Svelte Kit! So you can expect to see a portfolio project or two appear soon! Keep up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nategarrow_) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ntgarrow/)

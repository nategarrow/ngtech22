        I'm Nathan! By day, a frontend developer at RFTB, a bespoke WordPress
        digital experience agency based out of Weatherford, Texas. My day-to-day
        includes managing the entire life cycle of websites for local, national,
        and international property management companies, sites for institutions
        of higher education, or digital interactive app experiences for
        world-renowned art museums built with Ionic.

        announced soon), learning new skills (this page was my first steps with
        TypeScript!), camping and backpacking with my wife, playing Dungeons
        &amp; Dragons with friends, or{" "}

        Lately, my interests have included TypeScript, Three.js, Next.js, and
        Gatsby, as well as headless CMS's such as Strapi, Contentful, and
        Keystone.
